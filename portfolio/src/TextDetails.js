\nKashmir is renowned for the quality of its traditional crafts, and Qayoom himself was born into an artisan family. He grew up near the master craftsmen, learning about their world of arts and crafts. 
\nIt is Sozni’s mission to bring some of Kashmir’s beautifully made, unique and individual items to the wider world.At the same time, we aim to sustain the livelihood of our Kashmiri families and suppliers, giving them a fair price for their goods; items that they make from purely natural materials, in a timehonouredand traditional way.
\n
We also want to ensure that these skills, passed down through the generations, do not die out.•Sozni, spearheaded byQayoomand his Hong Kong born wife, originally traded in the Far East, gathering a large following. We have recently relocated to London and are in the process of building up an equally successful business here`;
